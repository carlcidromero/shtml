# `bashtml`

A Bash-based HTML generator.

## Goal

To enable users to reuse HTML layouts, patterns, and components via Bash scripts instead of JavaScript.

## Use case

Building a simple website that would be easier to maintain with some reusability of HTML layouts and patterns while keeping JavaScript solely responsible for the behavior of said website (as opposed to using JavaScript for something like web components, which would delve into the anatomy of a website).
